<h2>History of Calendars</h2>
<p>
The fundamental problems  that happened with early attempts at a calendar came from the ancients' guesses that were wrong:
<ul>
<li>sun cycles (years) do not contain a whole number of moon cycles (months), no matter how deep into denial you go; one year is 12.368270 moons
<li>moon cycles and earth cycles (days) don't divide evenly, either; there are 29.530589 days in a moon
<li>sun cycles and earth cycles also don't divide; there are 365.24231 days in a year

</ul>
It seems like it ought to work, you know, sun, moon, God, and all that; you'd think He'd have some whole numbers in there to make it easy.  But no.

<h2>Early Calendars</h2>

<p>
The Egyptians probably had a calendar as early as 3000bce - five thousand years ago.  It had 12 months of 30 days, each having three weeks of ten days.  That makes 360 days, hence our 360 degree circle.  When they noticed their seasons sliding ahead as the years went on, they added five days at the end of the year as leftovers.  Even with the five extra days, it slowly wandered around the solar year.  This wasn't fixed until 238bce.  The current Coptic and Ethiopian calendars descend from this calendar.  

<p>
The Greeks city-states each used different calendars; Athens itself had three different calendars.  The Festival calendar had twelve months, based, literally, relative to the phase of the moon.  Each month  started on the new moon (dark), with celebrations for several days.  If a festival day conflicted with an important meeting or military action, they'd just repeat the day to make room.  The greeks also tried to fit their months into a solar year, sortof, but every so often they'd double a month as a sorof leap-month when they thought they needed one.  The months were either 29 or 30 days, also decided irregularly.  The State calendar was more regular, having ten months spread over 365 or 366 days.  Farmers used a different calendar altogether that depended on star risings and settings.

<p>
In 434bce the Greek astronomer Meton of Athens standardized a Babylonian calendar with a system that fit 235 months into 19 years, with 7 leap months inserted according to a fixed schedule.  This is called a Metonic calendar; it's actually a good system for getting all three cycles to coincide; it slips one day about every 219 years.  Presently it's used in the Hebrew and Chinese calendars, and a few other more obscure south-asian calendars.  

<p>
The Chinese calendar is a lunar calendar, alternating 29-day and 30-day months, with an occasional leap day to synchronize with the actual moon.  Similarly, they added leap months to synchronize with the sun.  These decisions varied from one Chinese province to another.  The first month of the year was the one that started before, or after, the winter solstice (shortest day).  Eventually, they standardized on a Metonic calendar.  The details have been tweaked over the centuries, but it is still used today to time celebrations such as the Chinese New Year, although most people use the Gregorian calendar for practical purposes.

<p>
The Olmecs in Mexico settled on a 365 day year between 1600bce and 1200bce, along with a 260 day year for rituals and religion.  The Inca maintained two calendars, one solar, one lunar, in parallel.

<h2>Roman Calendars</h2>

The Romans had used a <i>nundinal</i> week of eight days.
It was named <i>nundinal</i> (9-ish) because, 
if you count the start of each of the eight days, 
and the end of the last day, that's nine. 
Right.  Eight days, named nine.  So already we see a problem.
Sometimes these were shifted a day forward or backward, 
to time celebrations or avoid bad luck.

<p>
Days in the month were counted, as usual, 
by the phase of the moon: 
days before the full (Ides), or new (Kalends), or waxing half moon (Nones).
In Roman numerals, of course.
So, the <i>Ides of March</i> was on the 15th.  
The day before was the <i>Pridie Ides</i>, whereas we would say the 14th.
The day after was the <i>Ante Diem XVII Kalends</i>.
Days ended, and the next day started, at high noon.

<p>
The year started on March 1, hence the months 7-10 named September thru December.
Roman years varied from 355 to 378 days, as determined by the Pontifex, 
and usually decided at the last minute.  
The Pontifex was sortof the pope of the Roman poytheistic religion, 
and the modern Pope descends from this concept.
The Pontifex added an extra month onto the end of the year, for the longer years.  
Now it turns out that the Pontifex had friends who were senators, consuls and other officeholders.
And also, enemies.
Their terms in office were measured in years.  
Years whose length was decided by the Pontifex.  
Yes, this was Italian politics; some things never change.

<p>
Years in Rome were sometimes counted from the founding of Rome, 
although there was disagreement about exactly when that was.  
At other times it was counted from the time the current pair of consuls were appointed, 
or when the current emperor took control.  
Since the news of these political changes took months to percolate through the empire, 
some dates used the wrong consuls.  
Out in the colonies (present-day Europe and the Mediterranean outside of Italy), 
years were counted from the time of Roman conquest at that location.

<p>
Our current year numbering system is derived from this practice of counting years from the ascendance of ruler, counting the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ, the King (although off by a few years).


<h2>Julian Calendar</h2>

In 46BCE, Julius Caesar became the Emperor of Rome.  
And, the Pontifex.
That year was 445 days long.  
At the time, many leap years had been missed for a total lag of about 1/3 of a year.  
He called together mathematicians and astronomers,
and forged a calendar with the best ideas of Greece, Egypt and Rome.

<p>
Caesar's reform had years with 365 days, with a leap year every 4 years.  Over the next few centuries, the calendar stabilized into a form very similar to what we use today.  Each month had the same number of days from one year to the next, except for the last month, February, which varied by only a day.  At last, people could make appointments in the future without having them move around unexpectedly.  People got used to the seasons falling on the same dates each year.

<p>
In Dial-A-Geddon, we use the Julian calendar for dates before 1582, 
when the Gregorian calendar took over. 
This includes dates before Julius himself, extending backwards for thousands of years (called the Proleptic Julian calendar).  
Years before year 1 are labeled <b>bce</b>, for Before Christian Era, although you can type in <b>bc</b> if you want.
Years after are labeled <b>ce</b>, or you can type in <b>ad</b> or just leave it off.  
There is no year zero; year 1ce comes right after year 1bce.
(People back then saw no need for a number zero.)

<p>
It's easy to calculate how many days there are between two widely separated years,
if you count the number of years (365 days apiece) 
plus the number of leap years (1 every 4 years).
Another way is to remember that 4 years is always 1461 days.


<h2>Gregorian Calendar</h2>

In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII decreed that after Thursday, October 4th, 
the next day would be Friday, October 15th, jumping 10 days.  
At the same time, he decreed that the rule for leap years would change slightly:
<ul>
<li>every round 100th year would <b>not</b> be a leap year, even though it was divisible by 4
<li>every round 400th year <b>would</b> be a leap year, even though it was divisible by 100
</ul>

<p>
The problem had been that the calendar was slipping relative to the seasons by about 1 day every 128 years.  
They could tell because the date of the equinox, the day whose night was equal to its day, was used to calculate Easter; and Easter was very important to the Church.  

<p>
The Gregorian calendar is now in use throughout the world as the standard in most western countries (although some countries dragged their feet and continued to use the Julian for centuries).  
The calendar on your wall and in your smartphone is the Gregorian calendar.
It's estimated that it'll fall behind about one day by the year 4000.

<p>
In Dial-A-Geddon, we use the Gregorian calendar for dates after this transition in October 1582.  
You can adjust for the Gregorian calendar by simply adjusting the number of leap years you use between dates.  
Another way is to remember that 400 years is always 146,097 days.


<h2>Shoes of the Foot Dragger</h2>
<p>
Many places didn't convert to the Gregorian calendar immediately, 
and some thought it was a Catholic plot.  
Some converted gradually, or changed back and forth as the government changed.  
Others were using another calendar system, often designed by religion or culture.

<h2>Islamic Calendar</h2>
<p>
The Arabs typically used a lunar calendar.  By the time of Mohammed, they were using leap months, sometimes called <i>Nasi'</i>.  God, as told through Mohammed and the Qur'an, prohibited this practice, because war was not permitted during four specific months of the year, and if you used these leap months, such <i>haram</i> months shifted around relative to the 'correct' months, and therefore were wrong.  Starting from July 16 in 622ce, which was the day that Mohammed moved from Mecca to Medina, the modern Islamic calendar starts, and proceeds forward with 12-month years of about 354 or 355 days.  Each month ends with a new moon, and is 29 or 30 days long, depending on whether a crescent moon can be seen at sunset on the 29th day.  To this day, this determination is made independently in each Islamic country, by some guy standing on a hilltop, looking at the moon.  Fortunately, he doesn't hold political office.  Of course, this is influenced by longitude, weather and proximity to light sources.  On average, though, the days are close to being synchronized, because it's the same moon.

<h2>other calendars</h2>
<p>
South asia uses a variety of calendars, most in India, and many are still in use today.  Calendars vary by country or Indian state, and by religion.  Some have been synchronized with the Gregorian calendar for simplicity, although they retain their month and weekday names.  The Hindu lunar cycles are actually measured as the moon cycles around the fixed star background, for a month of about 27.3 days.  This is called a siderial calendar.  Months are named after constellations (hence the 12 zodiacs), and there are many other details that are heavy on astrology and vary according to the specific calendar.  Interestingly, many weekday names are derived from the same planet names as those in the West.  For instance, <i>Sukra vasara</i> is the Sanskrit word for Friday.  <i>Sukra</i> means Venus, just like <i>venerdi</i>, Venus's day, is the Italian word for Friday.

<p>
Most other religions have had their own calendar; even recent ones like Scientology.  
The French Revolution got carried away and invented their own calendar, where each day had 10 hours, each with 100 minutes, each of which had 100 seconds.  (Metric was all the rage at the time.)
